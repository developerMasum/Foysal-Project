            <p class="text">If we were to look back at the one precise moment when The Belgian Waffle Co. sprung to life, it was when Shrey, while on a food experimentation spree while working internationally, stumbled upon this delectable, symmetrically-patterned and unique dessert cuisine that he couldn’t wait to take back with him to his country. He carefully packaged this idea and took it back with him all the way to India, where it eventually unfolded itself and took the form of the popular food franchise, The Belgian Waffle Co. Owned and operated by Bloombay Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., The Belgian Waffle Co. was founded in 2015, with its foundations firmly built on the values of excellence, simplicity and affordability. <br>
                Today, with 350+ stores across 100+ Indian cities, The Belgian Waffle Co. franchise is the recipient of prestigious awards, including the Franchisor of the Year “Dessert Category” award and the “Asia Food Innovation Awards”. <br>
                We have also expanded our portfolio of goodies to include a range of exciting ready-to-eat and easy-to-make products such as Waffle Crips, Spreads and Pancake and Waffle Premixes which are available across online and offline channels around the country. <br>
                But, hey! We firmly believe that our journey from 2015 to now is all thanks to your constant love and support. And with continuing encouragement from our fantastic BWC family, we hope to continue serving you with the most delectable treats in the years and decades to come!
